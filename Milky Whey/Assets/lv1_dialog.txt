I'm a robot.
Today is 3018/1/29. I'm still looking for more resources.
Twodays ago, I woke up.
I saw spaceships! Are someone coming back?
Who are they?
Enemy ship: we found resources.
Enemy main ship: ATTACT!
I have to leave.
There's too many of them
AND NO ONE WILL COME BACk.
I want to find them.
...
Look, the green gas planet
I need some of those gases to activate my ship
...
(collect 1000 gas resourse to escape)
