currently located in planet ACE
Today is 3018/1/29.
I'm still looking for more resources.
Two days ago, 
I woke up by the e-mail.
I see spaceships! 
Is someone coming back?
Who are they?
Enemy Ships: We found resources.
Enemy Ships: ATTACK!
I have to leave.
There are too many enemies.
And no one will come back.
I want to find them.
(. . .)
I need to collect resources to leave.
